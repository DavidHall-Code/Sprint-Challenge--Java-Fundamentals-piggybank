Explain the advantages of the project structure (packages) you used.
A: The 3 project packages that were added were: models, controllers and repositories. Models is where you would store

    getters. The repositories is the file that you use to extend the CRUD repository. Finally you have the controllers.
    This is where you write the code that utilizes code from the models as well as the database file (data.sql).
